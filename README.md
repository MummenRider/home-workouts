# At Home Workouts

This project is dedicated for creating a mobile application that supports one of the United Nation's goal, [Good Health and Well-Being](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/health/).

As of now, many Gyms across the globe are closing due to COVID 19 pandemic and because of this, many are stuck at their home with limited physical activates. To promote good health and well being, this mobile application will create workout activates that is catered based on user's body composition.
