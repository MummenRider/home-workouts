# Let's Get Physical

This project is dedicated for creating a mobile application that supports one of the United Nation's goal, [Good Health and Well-Being](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/health/).

A mobile application where people in a community can share their physical activity stories to other people. This application hopes to inspire people by seeing other people achieve their physical activity in a day. The application itself will be a tool that will help community to promote good health and healthy lifestyle.
